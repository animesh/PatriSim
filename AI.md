GitHub Copilot: # PatriSim Simulation Pipeline Analysis

This script runs a comprehensive genetic simulation pipeline that models and analyzes population genetics under different kinship systems. Here's what it does:

## 1. Parameter Setup
- Defines simulation parameters like descent rules (patrilineal/matrilineal), village structure, migration rates, and population sizes
- Configures whether to use random fission, violence models, and other demographic factors

## 2. Directory Structure Setup
- Creates organized directory structure for simulation outputs
- Sets up metric files to track population statistics

## 3. Simulation Process
- Runs SLiM (Simulation of Lineage with Mutations) simulations with specified parameters
- Performs optional "burnin" phase to establish baseline populations
- Runs parallel simulations (using multiple cores) for statistical robustness

## 4. Output Processing
- Generates VCF (Variant Call Format) files from simulation results
- Uses Python scripts to sample and process the simulated genetic data
- Creates subset trees based on the descent model (bilateral or unilineal)

## 5. Analysis Pipeline
- Calculates population genetic diversity metrics (Pi statistics)
- Generates Nexus files for phylogenetic analysis
- Performs Bayesian evolutionary inference using BEAST
- Creates skyline plots for demographic history visualization using R

The script appears designed to study how different kinship systems and social structures impact genetic diversity patterns in human populations, with particular focus on comparing patrilineal and matrilineal descent systems.

animesh: can you write a script to simulate matrilineal evolution

Workspace: Sure, here's a proposed directory structure for a matrilineal evolution

animesh: run the simulation

GitHub Copilot: # Running the Matrilineal Evolution Simulation

To run the matrilineal simulation, you need to execute the script with proper permissions. Here are the steps:

1. First, make sure the script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x /workspaces/PatriSim/MatriSim/PatriSim/matriSim.sh
```

2. Then run the simulation:

```bash
/workspaces/PatriSim/MatriSim/PatriSim/matriSim.sh
```

Alternatively, you can run it using bash directly:

```bash
bash /workspaces/PatriSim/MatriSim/PatriSim/matriSim.sh
```

The script is configured for matrilineal evolution with these key settings:
- `descent_rule="matrilineal"`
- `nameDir="matrilineal_villages"`
- Female migration rate (`mf=0.1`) with no male migration (`mm=0`)

The simulation will:
1. Run a burnin phase
2. Execute the SLiM simulations with matrilineal parameters
3. Process the output into VCF files
4. Calculate genetic diversity metrics
5. Perform Bayesian inference using BEAST
6. Generate skyline plots for visualization

The results will be stored in directories with the `matrilineal_villages` naming pattern.
